This thesis contains the following published works where  I am a contributing author.  I will state my contribution in the following papers:

{\bf Chapter} \ref{chpt:survey}, is based on a survey paper on Deep Learning for Anomaly detection;
\begin{itemize}
%\item
 \item \bibentry{MySurvey}
%\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

{\bf Chapter} \ref{chpt:supervisedDAD}, is based on two workshop papers published  on supervised multi-class classification based techniques for outlier detection;
\begin{itemize}
%\item
 \item \bibentry{Chalapathy2016AnIO}
 \item \bibentry{Chalapathy2016BidirectionalLF}
%\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


{\bf Chapter} \ref{chapt:OCNNforAD} is composed from a  paper
 where one class neural network models are applied for detecting anomalies.

\end{itemize}

{\bf Chapter}  \ref{chpt:UnsupervisedDAD} comprises of proposed unsupervised  deep learning based anomaly detection algorithms for detecting individual and group anomalies. {\bf Section} \ref{sec:robustAD} is composed from a paper published on leveraging robust deep techniques for anomaly detection. {\bf Section} \ref{sec:dgm} composed from a joint paper where deep generative models are applied for detecting group anomalies. I specialise in formulating the deep generative models for group anomaly detection while Eddie specialise and describe the area of group anomaly detection.
