\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have extended the robust PCA model to the nonlinear autoencoder setting.
To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first approach which is \emph{robust}, \emph{nonlinear} and \emph{inductive}.
The robustness ensures that the model is not over-sensitive
to anomalies;
the nonlinearity helps discover potentially more
subtle anomalies;
and being inductive makes it possible
to deploy our model in a live setting.

While autoencoders are a powerful mechansim for data representation
they suffer from their ``black-box'' nature. There is a growing
body of research on outlier description, i.e., explain the reason
why a data point is anomalous. A direction of future reason is
to extend deep autoencoders for outlier \emph{description}.
