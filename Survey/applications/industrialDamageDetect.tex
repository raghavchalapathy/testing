\subsection{Industrial Anomalies Detection}

Industrial systems consisting of wind turbines, power plants, high-temperature energy systems, storage devices and  with rotating mechanical parts are exposed to enormous stress on a day-to-day basis. Damage to these type of systems not only causes economic loss but also a loss of reputation, therefore detecting and repairing them early is of utmost importance. Several machine learning techniques have been used to detect such damage in industrial systems ~\cite{ramotsoela2018survey,marti2015anomaly}, following the recent success of deep learning several papers published utilizing deep learning models show great promise~\cite{atha2018evaluation,de2018automatic,wang2018residential}. Damages caused to equipments are rare events, thus  detecting such events can be formulated as outlier detection problem. The challenges associated with outlier detection in this domain is both volume as well as dynamic nature of data, since failure can be caused due to variety of factors. Some deep anomaly detection techniques employed across various industries are shown in Table ~\ref{tab:industrialDamageDetect}.
