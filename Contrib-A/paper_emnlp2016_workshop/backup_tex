\section{Introduction}
Pharmacovigilance (PV) is defined by the World Health Organization as the science and activities related to the detection, assessment, understanding and prevention of adverse effects or any other drug-related problem.Drug name recognition (DNR) is a fundamental step in Pharmacovigilance (PV) pipeline and is  analogous to Named-Entity Recognition (NER), a well studied research problem in natural language processing.DNR aims to find drug name mentions in unstructured biomedical texts and classify them into pre-defined categories.
Conventional  research techniques  for DNR  are  dictionary-based methods(Hettne, K. et.al, 2009), rule-based methods(Hamon, T et.al, 2010) and statistical machine learning methods (Shengyu Liu et.al, 2015) (Alberto Lavelli et.al, 2015).Unstructured medical text incorporates abbreviated words and lack  formal sentence structure and  punctuation rules which renders  rule based systems as ineffective and not scalable.DNR naming convention do not follow specific pattern. For instance, the drug “quetiapine” (generic name) has the brand name “Seroquel XR”, while its systematic International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name is “2-[2-(4-dibenzo [b,f][1,4] thiazepin-11-ylpiperazin-1-yl) ethoxy] ethanol”. With rapid explosion of discovery of new drugs , some drug names are coined following mundane english words or phrases. For instance, brand names of “oxymetazoline nasal” and “caffeine” are “Duration” and “Stay Awake”, respectively(Shengyu Liu et.al, 2015). These inconsistencies pose challenges for dictionary-based methods.
The machine learning models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) [3], Maximum Entropy (ME) [4], Hidden Markov Model (HMM) [5] and Conditional Random Fields (CRF) [6], have been adopted to address DNR task  offers superior performance over rule-based and dictionary  methods. But these machine learning methods require hand-crafted features to be designed which is time consuming and expensive. Also for different medical  corpora and languages feature engineering is laborious. Some drug names may correspond to non-continuous strings of text. For example, “loop diuretics” and “potassium-sparing diuretics” in the sentence “In some patients, the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing and thiazide diuretics”(Shengyu Liu et.al, 2015). Such examples pose great difficulties to DNR. Although there are a few approaches proposed to recognize both continuous and non-continuous named entities such as disorders   [96] [98], they still perform poorly for non-continuous named entities. 
Deep learning has been applied on NER in recent years. Collobert et al. [7].  Leveraging RNN’s recurrent property, in this paper we explore  two simple types of RNN models Elman-type and Jordan-type networks on DrugBank and MedLine dataset(SemEval, 2013). The experimental results prove the effectiveness of deep sequential recurrent neural networks to identify drug names as an alternative to hand-crafted feature engineering approach.


\section{Related Work}

Several research methodologies  proposed for the recognition of drug names are mostly devoted to hand-crafted rule and feature engineering based systems which are intrinsically domain dependent. The impact of incorporating domain-specific features on DNR was emphasised by WBI-NER team \cite{huber2013wbi}  ranked first in the SemEval-2013 Task 9.1: Recognition and classification of pharmacological substances. WBI-NER system adopted CRF algorithm for classification along with features derived  from improved version of the ChemSpot tool  and collection of drug dictionaries and ontologies \cite{rocktaschel2012chemspot}.
There are two major  limitations  reported by WBI-NER, firstly  system fails to  correctly classify entities of the minority class (DrugN). Secondly it requires domain adaptation techniques to obtain better performance on DDI-DrugBank and DDI-MEDLINE documents. Feature conjunction and feature selection method adopted  in \cite{liu2015feature} report  better  results than  WBI-NER system. However, since the authors only provide results for the whole DDI corpus, one cannot know the performance of their system on each dataset and whether their system is able to outperform the WBI-NER system on the DDI-MedLine dataset.Another approach is   using word2vec embeddings and DINTO ontology, demonstrate the effectiveness of application of ontologies in order to  improve classifier precision  on the DDI-MedLine dataset. However, this system in general does not perform better than WBI-NER  on  SemEval-2013 Task 9.1 Drug Name Recognition \cite{segura2015exploring}. 
In recent years RNNs have offered great promise for NER which is homologous to DNR. The models proposed by \cite{collobert2011natural} followed by many including \cite{mesnil2013,mesnil2015using}  leverage  RNNs to deliver end-to-end NER. This paper explores the effectiveness of  recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to  jointly perform feature extraction and  classification in a sequential mode. The experiments conducted on SemEval-2013 Task 9.1 Drug Name Recognition task demonstrate  RNN models significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods.

\section{The Proposed Approach}
The EMNLP 2016 style defines a printed ruler which should be present in the
version submitted for review.  The ruler is provided in order that
reviewers may comment on particular lines in the paper without
circumlocution.  If you are preparing a document without the provided
style files, please arrange for an equivalent ruler to
appear on the final output pages.  The presence or absence of the ruler
should not change the appearance of any other content on the page.  The
camera ready copy should not contain a ruler. (\LaTeX\ users may uncomment
the {\small\verb|\emnlpfinalcopy|} command in the document preamble.)  

Reviewers:
note that the ruler measurements do not align well with lines in the paper
--- this turns out to be very difficult to do well when the paper contains
many figures and equations, and, when done, looks ugly.  Just use fractional
references (e.g., the first line on this page is at mark $096.5$), although
in most cases one would expect that the approximate location will be
adequate.

\subsection{Deep Sequential Modelling for DNR}

EMNLP provides this description to authors in \LaTeX2e{} format
and PDF format, along with the \LaTeX2e{} style file used to format it
({\small\tt emnlp2016.sty}) and an ACL bibliography style
({\small\tt emnlp2016.bst}) and example bibliography
({\small\tt emnlp2016.bib}). A Microsoft Word template file
({\small\tt emnlp2016.dotx}) is also available. We strongly recommend the
use of these style files, which have been appropriately tailored for the
EMNLP 2016 proceedings.


The DDIExtraction 2013 challenge  provides benchmark DDI corpus which is manually  annotated with pharmacological substances as well as the drug to drug interations (DDIs). The corpus contains a total of 18,502 pharmacological substances and 5,028 DDIs. It consists of two different datasets: DDI-DrugBank (792 texts selected from the DrugBank database) and DDI-MedLine (233 MedLine abstracts on the subject of DDIs). The corpus is split into datasets for the training and evaluation of the  different participating systems. Approximately 77\% of the DDI corpus documents were randomly selected for the training dataset and the remaining as test dataset for both DDI-DrugBank and DDI-MedLine respectively \cite{herrero2013ddi}. The DDI corpus  provides a common framework for the evaluation of information extraction techniques applied for two SemEval2013 subtasks,  Task 9.1: The recognition of pharmacological substances also known as Drug NER or DNR task, Task 9.2: The detection of DDIs from biomedical texts drug to drug interaction (DDI task). A very minimal preprocessing step, to extract train and test sentences from DDI corpus is adopted to prepare the data for the experiments conducted.  The training data set of SemEval2013 subtask 9.1 along with test data set provided for SemEval2013 subtask 9.2 provided by DDI corpus is utilised for training  as shown in Table 1 which, summarizes the basic  statistics on training and test dataset  used in DNR experiments. Further the training sentences are split into train and validation set with approximately 70\% of sentences,  randomly selected for training  and remaining  as validation, for both DDI-DrugBank and DDI-MedLine datasets. 
 

\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:length}

The EMNLP 2016 main conference accepts submissions of long papers and
short papers.  Long papers may consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus
two (2) pages for references. Upon acceptance, final versions of long papers
will be given one additional page (i.e., up to 9 pages) for content, with
unlimited pages for references --- so that reviewers' comments can be taken
into account.  Short papers may consist of up to four (4) pages of content,
plus two (2) pages for references. Upon acceptance, the final version of
short papers will be given five (5) pages in the proceedings, with unlimited
pages for references.  For both long and short papers, all illustrations and
appendices must be accommodated within these page limits, observing the
formatting instructions given in the present document.  Papers that do not
conform to the specified length and formatting requirements are subject to
be rejected without review.

EMNLP 2016 encourages submitting software and data that is described in the
paper as supplementary material. EMNLP 2016 also encourages reporting
preprocessing decisions, model parameters, and other details necessary for the
exact replication of the experiments described in the paper. Papers may be
accompanied by supplementary material, consisting of software, data, pseudo-code,
detailed proofs or derivations that do not fit into the paper, lists of features
or feature templates, parameter specifications, and sample inputs and outputs
for a system. The paper should not rely on the supplementary material: while the
paper may refer to and cite the supplementary material and the supplementary
material will be available to reviewers, they will not be asked to review the
supplementary material.

\subsection{Experimental Results}
\label{ssec:accessibility}

In an effort to accommodate the color-blind (and those printing to paper),
grayscale readability of papers is encouraged. Color is not forbidden, but 
authors should ensure that tables and figures do not rely solely on color to
convey critical distinctions.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:blind}

Rapid progress in pharmaceutical research has led to continuous  discoveries of  new drugs, which inturn necessitates automatic drug name discovery in unstructured biomedical texts. This paper investigates, the effectiveness of  short term memory (STM) networks essentially Elman and Jordon type  RNNs to jointly perform feature extraction and  classification in a sequential mode for SemEval-2013 Task 9.1 Drug Name Recognition. The  experimental results are very promising and demonstrate that STM networks based DNR system substantially  outperforms  state-of-the-art methods. These models set a new state-of-the-art in this area. Investigation of variants of STM architectures for more challenging DNR tasks, for example ones that involve a number of symbols mixed with common words, which pose boundary detection challenges, is part of future work. Additionally,  extending  the experiments  to the ChemdNER corpus in order to compare our approach to the participating systems of the BioCreative IV CHEMDNER task is also an interesting furture direction.

\subsubsection{Results on DDI-DrugBank}
The use of a lexicon feature from DINTOachieved an increase in both precision and recall (and con- sequently, an improvement of 1\% in F1 score). The results suggest that Word2vec features
can potentially lead to improved detection performance. In general, the use of word clus- ters showed a significant increase in recall values (from 84\% to 89\%), and hence a gain of 3\% in F1. However, word clusters did not seem signif- icantly to alter overall precision values. As ex- pected,


\subsubsection{Results on DDI-MedLine}

The use of DINTO led to an increase in precision, achieving 10\% over the baseline system, and an increase of 3\% in recall. Thus, F1-score went up from 61\% to 66\%. Word cluster features generated fromWikipedia
provided a significant improvement of 6\% in re- call, but with worse precision than the combina- tion of baseline with DINTO. As was the case on DDI-DrugBank, lower improvements were ob- tained by the word clusters trained on MedLine. Moreover, word provided a significant improvement of 6\% in re- call, but with worse precision than the combina- tion of baseline with DINTO. provided a significant  DINTO.
