\section{Experimental Results}
\label{sec:experiment-results}

Table \ref{table3} shows the performance comparison between the explored RNNs and state-of-the-art DNR systems. As an overall note, the RNNs have not reached the same accuracy as the top system, WBI-NER \cite{huber2013wbi}. However, the bidirectional LSTM-CRF has achieved the second-best score on DDI-DrugBank and the third-best on DDI-MedLine. These results seem interesting on the ground that the RNNs provide DNR straight from text rather than from manually-engineered features. Given that the RNNs learn entirely from the data, the better performance over the DDI-DrugBank dataset is very likely due to its larger size. Accordingly, it is reasonable to expect higher relative performance should larger corpora become available in the future. Table \ref{table4} also breaks down the results by entity class for the bidirectional LSTM-CRF. The low score on the $brand$ class for DDI-MedLine and on the $drug\_n$ class (i.e., active substances not approved for human use) for DDI-DrugBank  are likely attributable to the very small sample size (Table \ref{table2}). This issue is also shared by the state-of-the-art DNR systems.
