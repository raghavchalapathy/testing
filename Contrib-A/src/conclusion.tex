\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
This paper has investigated the effectiveness of recurrent neural architectures, namely the Elman and Jordan networks and the bidirectional LSTM-CRF, for drug name recognition. The most appealing feature of these architectures is their ability to provide end-to-end recognition straight from text, sparing effort from laborious feature construction. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first paper to explore RNNs for entity recognition from pharmacological text. The experimental results over the SemEval-2013 Task 9.1 benchmarks look promising, with the bidirectional LSTM-CRF ranking closely to the state of the art. A potential way to  further improve its performance would be to initialize its training with unsupervised word embeddings such as Word2Vec~\cite{Mikolov:13} and GloVe~\cite{Pennington:14}. This approach has proved effective in many other domains and still dispenses with expert annotation effort; we plan this exploration for the near future.
