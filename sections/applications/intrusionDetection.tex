\subsection{Intrusion Detection}
\label{sec:intrusion_detection}

Intrusion detection  system (IDS) refers to identifying malicious activity in a computer related system~\cite{phoha2002internet}. IDS may be deployed at single computers known as Host Intrusion Detection (HIDS) to large networks Network Intrusion Detection (NIDS). The classification of deep anomaly detection techniques for intrusion detection is in Figure ~\ref{sec:intrusionDetect}. IDS depending on detection method are classified into signature based or anomaly based. Using signature based IDS is not efficient to detect new attacks, for which no specific signature pattern is available, hence anomaly based detection methods are more popular. In this survey we focus on deep anomaly detection (DAD) methods and architectures eemployed in intrusion detection.

\subsubsection{Host-Based Intrusion Detection Systems:}
 Such systems are installed software programs which monitors a single host or computer for malicious  activity or policy violations by listening to system calls or events occurring within that host ~\cite{vigna2005host}. The system call logs could be generated by programs or by user interaction resulting in logs as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:deeplogContextual}. Malicious interactions lead to execution of these system calls in different sequences. HIDS may also monitor the state of a system, its stored information, whether in Random Access Memory (RAM), in the file system, log files or elsewhere for a valid sequence, hence the length of the sequence for each program may be different.
 Deep anomaly detection (DAD) techniques applied for HIDS are required to handle the sequential nature of data. The DAD techniques have to either model the sequence data or compute similarity between sequences. Some of the successfull DAD techniques for HIDS is illustrated in Table~\ref{tab:HIDS}.

\subsubsection{Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS):} NIDS systems deal with monitoring the entire network for suspicious traffic by examining each and every network packet. Owing to real-time streaming behaviour, the nature of data is synomynous to big data with high volume, velocity, variety. The network data also has a temporal aspect associated with it. Some of the successfull DAD techniques for NIDS is illustrated in Table~\ref{tab:NIDS}. This survey also lists the datasets used for evaluating the DAD intrusion detection methods proposed in Table~\ref{tab:IDSDataset}. A challenge faced by deep anomaly detection techniques in intrusion detection is that the nature of anomalies keeps changing over time as the intruders adapt their network attacks to evade the existing intrusion detection solutions.
