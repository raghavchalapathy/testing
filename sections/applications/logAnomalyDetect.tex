\subsection{Log Anomaly Detection:}
Anomaly detection in log file aims to find text which can indicate the reasons and the nature of failure of a system. Most commonly, a domain  specific regular-expression  is contructed from past experience which finds new faults by pattern matching, the limitation of such approach is that newer messages of failures are easily are not detected~\cite{memon2008log}. The unstructured and diversity in both format and semantics of log data pose significant challenges to anomaly detection. Futhermore log data is produced in real time with large volume and speed, hence anomaly detection techniques should adapt to this concurrent setting and detect outliers in real time  in order to be useful so that users can take appropriate actions. Following the success of deep neural networks in text analysis in real time, several deep anomaly detection (DAD) techniques are proposed to detect outliers in log data as illustrated in Table~\ref{tab:logAnomalyDetect}. DAD methods model system log as a natural language sequence.
