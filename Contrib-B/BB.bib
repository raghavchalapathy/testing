@article{MHT2,
abstract = {In quantitative proteomics work, the differences in expression of many separate proteins are routinely examined to test for significant differences between treatments. This leads to the multiple hypothesis testing problem: when many separate tests are performed many will be significant by chance and be false positive results. Statistical methods such as the false discovery rate (FDR) method that deal with this problem have been disseminated for more than one decade. However a survey of proteomics journals shows that such tests are not widely implemented in one commonly used technique, quantitative proteomics using two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE). We outline a selection of multiple hypothesis testing methods, including some that are well known and some lesser known, and present a simple strategy for their use by the experimental scientist in quantitative proteomics work generally. The strategy focuses on the desirability of simultaneous use of several different methods, the choice and emphasis dependent on research priorities and the results in hand. This approach is demonstrated using case scenarios with experimental and simulated model data.},

Nachr. 137 (1988) 249-256) revealed a new phenomenon in classical central limit theory and has led to an extensive literature in the past decade. In particular, a.s. central limit theorems and various related 'logarithmic' limit theorems have been obtained for several classes of independent and dependent random variables. In this paper we extend this theory and show that not only the central limit theorem, but every weak limit theorem for independent random variables, subject to minor technical conditions, has an analogous almost sure version. For many classical limit theorems this involves logarithmic averaging, as in the case of the CLT, but we need radically different averaging processes for 'more sensitive' limit theorems. Several examples of such a.s. limit theorems are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Our theorem is a generalization of previous results. Some examples are given that show that the generalization is useful. In particular, we consider the limiting behavior of the sample mean of a combined sample of independent long-memory sequences, the limiting behavior of a spectral estimator, and the moving blocks bootstrap distribution. The examples make it clear the consideration of asymptotic behavior with the amount of dependence m increasing with n is useful even when the underlying processes are weakly dependent (or even independent), because certain natural statistics that arise in the analysis of time series have this structure. In addition, we provide an example to demonstrate the sharpness of our result.},

@article{dMHT,
abstract = {Benjamini and Hochberg suggest that the false discovery rate may be the appropriate error rate to control in many applied multiple testing problems. A simple procedure was given there as an FDR controlling procedure for independent test statistics and was shown to be much more powerful than comparable procedures which control the traditional family wise error rate. We prove that this same procedure also controls the false discovery rate when the test statistics have positive regression dependency on each of the test statistics corresponding to the true null hypotheses. This condition for positive dependency is general enough to cover many problems of practical interest, including the comparisons of many treatments with a single control, multivariate normal test statistics with positive correlation matrix and multivariate t. Furthermore, the test statistics may be discrete, and the tested hypotheses composite without posing special difficulties. For all other forms of dependency, a simple conservative modification of the procedure controls the false discovery rate. Thus the range of problems for which a procedure with proven FDR control can be offered is greatly increased.},

Rather, it uses representative work to characterize key topics, and focuses on recent work that breaks new ground to help move theory and research forward. Although our approach risks trading breadth for depth, we believe that there is much value in taking a more integrative view of the important areas of team research, identifying key research themes, and linking the themes and disparate topics closer together. To the extent that we identify new and necessary areas of theory development and research, the value of this approach will be evident.},

Moreover, build-ings have a great potential for helping to meet energy efficiency targets. Hence, energy saving goals that target buildings can have a significant contribution in reducing environmental impact. Today's smart buildings achieve energy efficiency by monitoring energy usage with the aim of detecting and diagnosing abnormal energy consumption behaviour. This research proposes a generic collective contextual anomaly detection (CCAD) framework that uses sliding window approach and integrates historic sensor data along with generated and contextual features to train an autoencoder to recognize normal consumption patterns. Subse-quently, by determining a threshold that optimizes sensitivity and specificity, the framework identifies abnormal consumption behaviour. The research compares two models trained with different features using real-world data provided by Powersmiths, located in Brampton, Ontario, Canada.},

@article{Shaffer1995,
abstract = {In quantitative proteomics work, the differences in expression of many separate proteins are routinely examined to test for significant differences between treatments. This leads to the multiple hypothesis testing problem: when many separate tests are performed many will be significant by chance and be false positive results. Statistical methods such as the false discovery rate (FDR) method that deal with this problem have been disseminated for more than one decade. However a survey of proteomics journals shows that such tests are not widely implemented in one commonly used technique, quantitative proteomics using two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE). We outline a selection of multiple hypothesis testing methods, including some that are well known and some lesser known, and present a simple strategy for their use by the experimental scientist in quantitative proteomics work generally. The strategy focuses on the desirability of simultaneous use of several different methods, the choice and emphasis dependent on research priorities and the results in hand. This approach is demonstrated using case scenarios with experimental and simulated model data.},

The resulting prediction error is used to measure the amount of information that a local unit possesses about the collective dynamics.

The prediction error exhibits phase transitions at critical values of the coupling for the onset of ordered collective behavior in these networks. This information measure may be used as an order parameter for the characterization of complex behavior in extended chaotic systems.},

Our interest in this paper is central limit theorems for functions of random variables under mixing conditions. We impose mixing conditions on the differences between the joint cumulative distribution functions and the product of the marginal cumulative distribution functions.

abstract="Fraud and abuse have led to significant additional expense in the healthcare system of the United States. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive survey of the statistical methods applied to healthcare fraud detection, with focuses on classifying fraudulent behaviors, identifying the major sources and characteristics of the data based on which fraud detection has been conducted, discussing the key steps in data preprocessing, as well as summarizing, categorizing, and comparing statistical fraud detection methods. Based on this survey, some discussion is provided about what has been lacking or under-addressed in the existing research, with the purpose of pinpointing some future research directions.",
