Given a portfolio of stocks or a series of frames in a video how do we detect significant changes in a group of values for real-time applications? 
In this section,% we formalise the problem of sequentially detecting temporal changes in a group of stochastic processes.  As a solution to this particular problem,
 we propose the group temporal change (GT$\Delta$) algorithm, a simple yet effective technique for the sequential detection of significant changes in a variety of statistical properties of a group over time.  
 Due to the flexible framework of the GT$\Delta$ algorithm, a domain expert is able to select one or more statistical properties that they are interested in monitoring over a period of time. The usefulness of our proposed algorithm is also demonstrated against state-of-the-art techniques on synthetically generated data as well as on two real-world applications; a portfolio of healthcare stocks over a twenty year period and a video monitoring the solar flare activity of our Sun.

%Given a portfolio of stocks or a series of frames in a surveillance video, how do we detect dynamic temporal changes in their collective behaviors over a period of time? We focus on the online discovery of temporal changes when group memberships are known. % in an online setting.
% As a solution to this novel problem, we propose GRACE, an algorithm that is scalable, robust and flexible in its characterization of groups. %To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first online algorithm for detecting anomalous changes in dynamic groups.
%In this section, we simulate the theoretical distribution of test statistics computed in GRACE as well as conduct a robust comparison study with   state-of-the-art models. We also apply our proposed method on two real world datasets, a portfolio of health care stocks and video footage recording the movement of pedestrians.
