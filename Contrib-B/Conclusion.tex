\section{Conclusion
 } \label{Sec:Conclusion}
 This paper has used the contemporary bidirectional LSTM-CRF, for clinical concept extraction. The most appealing feature of this sytem   is their ability to provide end-to-end recognition initialized with general purpose off-the-shelf word embeddings sparing effort from laborious feature construction. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first paper to adopt bidirectional LSTM-CRF for concept extraction from clinical records. The experimental results over the  2010 i2b2/VA reference standard corpora look promising, with the bidirectional LSTM-CRF ranking closely to the state of the art. A potential way to further improve its performance would be to initialize its training with unsupervised word embeddings such as Word2Vec~\cite{Mikolov:13} and GloVe~\cite{Pennington:14} trained with domain specific resources such as Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC) II copora. This approach has proved effective in many other domains and still dispenses with expert annotation effort; we plan this exploration for the near future.
